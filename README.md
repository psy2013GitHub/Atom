Detailed Illustration:
  ATOM (Automatic Toolbox of MRI Scientist) is a convenient toolbox for fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) data analysis. It is based on SPM. ATOM is designed for pipeline analysis including automatic dicom to nifiti convertion, slicetiming, realign, normalization, smooth and nuisance effect exlution.
  The main advantage of ATOM is that it allow you to process your data in any order, since there still debates with regards to fMRI data preprocesing(see the listed references).
