function struct12 = psom_merge_pipeline(struct1,struct2,prefix)
% Merge two pipelines (or any two arbitrary structures with one entry).
%
% SYNTAX:
%   PIPE12 = PSOM_MERGE_PIPELINE(PIPE1,PIPE2,PREFIX)
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% INPUTS:
%
% PIPE1   
%    (structure) with one entry.
%
% PIPE2   
%    (structure) with one entry.
%
% PREFIX 
%    (string, default '') a prefix added to all field names in PIPE2 before
%    merging.
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% OUTPUTS:
%
% PIPE12  
%       (structure) combines the fields of PIPE1 and PIPE2. 
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% COMMENTS:
%
% If structures have fields in common, the fields of PIPE2 override the
% ones of PIPE1.
%
% For speed optimization, the smallest structure should be passed as
% PIPE2.
