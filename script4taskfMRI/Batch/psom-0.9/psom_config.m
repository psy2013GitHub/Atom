function opt = psom_config(path_test,opt,tests,time_wait)
% Test the configuration of PSOM
%
% SYNTAX:
% OPT = PSOM_CONFIG(PATH_TEST,OPT,TESTS,TIME_WAIT)
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% INPUTS:
%
% PATH_TEST
%    (string, default local_path_demo defined in the file 
%    PSOM_GB_VARS) the full path to folder where the tests will run. 
%    IMPORTANT WARNING : PSOM will empty totally this folder and then 
%    build example files and logs in it.
%
% OPT
%    (structure, optional) the options normally passed to PSOM_RUN_PIPELINE. 
%    Note that the OPT.PATH_LOGS field will be set to [PATH_TEST /logs/].
%    Type "help psom_run_pipeline" for more infos. Note that the defaults 
%    options can be changed by editing the file PSOM_GB_VARS. If you do not 
%    have the permission to edit this file, just copy it under the name 
%    PSOM_GB_VARS_LOCAL and add it to the search path, it will override 
%    PSOM_GB_VARS.
%
% TESTS
%   (string, or cell of strings, default: all tests) The list of tests to be
%   performed (see also the COMMENTs section below):
%   'script_pipe' : Run a simple script       (pipeline manager test)
%   'matlab_pipe' : Start matlab in a script  (pipeline manager test)
%   'psom_pipe'   : Start PSOM in a script    (pipeline manager test)
%   'script_job'  : Run a simple script       (job manager test)
%   'matlab_job'  : Start matlab in a script  (job manager test)
%   'psom_job'    : Start PSOM in a script    (job manager test)
%
% TIME_WAIT
%    (integer, default 60) the time (in seconds) that PSOM will wait 
%    before a submission to a queue system is considered as failed.
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% OUTPUTS:
% 
% OPT
%    (structure) an updated version of the input, populated with default 
%    values.

% PSOM_RUN_SCRIPT, PSOM_RUN_PIPELINE, PSOM_DEMO_PIPELINE
% 
% _________________________________________________________________________
% COMMENTS:
%
% NOTE 1:
%    PATH_TEST is erased and then populated with (small) test files.
%
% NOTE 2:
%    This function will test the PSOM configuration step-by-step, and will 
%    produce reasonably explicit error messages if an error occurs at any 
%    stage. PSOM_RUN_PIPELINE is assuming a correct configuration, and will 
%    fail without producing informative error messages if there is a problem.
%
% NOTE 3:
%    A "pipeline manager test" means that the test will run in the same 
%    conditions as the pipeline manager (OPT.MODE_PIPELINE_MANAGER).
%
% NOTE 4:
%    A "job manager test" means that the test will run in the same conditions
%    as the job manager: a first process will be started in
%    OPT.MODE_PIPELINE_MANAGER mode, which will itself start a process in 
%    OPT.MODE mode.
